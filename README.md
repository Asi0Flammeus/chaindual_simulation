# Simulation Model of Chain Dual

Minimalistic model of chain dual to analyse several strategies 

# Various notes

- illegal move: up/down oscillation observed for AI 
- enhance scoring model
  - does removing points to opponent when food is gained for 1st food change something?
  - add the multiplication factor dependant of snake's length
  - set a maximum score to end game and declare winner
- add simulation mode
  - no grid displayed
  - only score recorded in txt file 
    - each line is a game like `(1,0);(2,0);(2,1)`
